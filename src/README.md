# src

Here, I put only top level files and the root folder for all else within the app

## Information

The general gist of what I aim to do here is to have each route as it's own bundle (code splitting)

### So because of this

- I must separate all code related to said route within specified folders for organisational reasons
- I must have folders for shared components, css, etc.
- There will also be a folder specifically for utilities only related to the top level of the frontend
