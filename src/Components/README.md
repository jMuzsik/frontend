# Components

Antd is the component library but often I will need to hook components with hooks. This is the predominant reason for additional components on top of a component library. Also, I a custom look will be needed from time to time.

For now, I will use Antd before making components. ie. as much as I can lean on antd the better.

I will need to do performance optimisations later but for now I simply want to create a quality product.
